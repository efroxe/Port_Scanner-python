# Port_Scanner-python

To use this tool called "Console Port Scanner", you need to enter 
an IP address (NOT IPv6). It might take a long time to scan ports,
by default it scans 450 ports starting from port 50. It ususally takes
20 mins to scan 450 ports. To change that, open in any text editor
(preferably python IDE if you have installed it or any other IDE for 
python), go to line 26. The first number is the starting port (50) and 
the other number is the last port (500). Change it the way you want to.

(WARNING)! Some parts of the code can of course be written in a 
simpler way, but for good purposes they are written in some type
of encoded text although it is obvious.

To enter your IP address (dynamic), press windows+R and type "cmd".
After that type "ipconfig". It shows the IP configuration of the computer.
The tool does NOT steal any IPs, it just scans the given IP.

It is preffered to run the .py file in the windows terminal (CMD, CLI).
